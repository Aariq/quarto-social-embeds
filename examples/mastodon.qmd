You can obtain the username and status id of a tweet by clicking the "share tweet" button and choosing "copy URL".

This will give you a URL like this one: `https://twitter.com/juliesquid/status/1557485909486059523`.
The "user" is the section between `twitter.com/` and `/status`.
The status "id" is everything between `status/` and the end of the URL or `?`, whichever comes first.
